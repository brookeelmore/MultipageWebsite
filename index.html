        <p> My name is Brooke Elmore, and I am an undergraduate student studying Graphic and and Information Design at Northeastern University.
I have explored my passion for design at Northeastern through my involvement in Scout, our design studio on campus. I have worked on both the Labs and Studio teams, exploring both human-centered design thinking processes and designing brand identities.
One of my favorite activities is sharing my gluten-free food finds on my blog and Instagram, which has over 8,200 followers. I have worked on paid collaborations with global brands to create engaging content for their followers and my own. My instagram is @Celiactivist and my blog can be found at celiactivistblog.com.
I am passionate about the intersections of social media and design. My freelance social media work at Loud+Clear and my Marketing and Design co-op at EF Tours for Girls have provided me with ample experience in this space. I am now looking to pursue the intersection of food and design as I search for a second co-op position for the spring of 2022.
